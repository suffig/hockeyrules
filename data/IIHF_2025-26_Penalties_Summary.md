"Short-handed" means team is below opponent's numerical strength on ice when goal is scored.

- Major penalties do NOT terminate on goals
- Misconduct penalties do not cause team to be short-handed (unless combined with minor/major)

### Automatic Game Misconduct Triggers
1. Second major penalty in same game (20.4)
2. Second misconduct penalty in same game (22.1)
3. Specific infractions explicitly listed in Rule 20.4 and Table 6

### Delayed Penalty
When non-puck-controlling team commits infraction:
- Referee raises arm to signal
- Play continues
- Penalty assessed when offending team gains control
- Does NOT apply to equal coincidental penalties

### Video Review of Penalties
- Double-minor for High-sticking: Optional review (may confirm or nullify)
- Major penalties: Mandatory review (may confirm, reduce to lesser penalty, or nullify)
- Fighting: Only "Sucker puncher" can be reviewed
- Applied only in certain IIHF Championships
